(* Proof of Security *)
We first want to define our desired NOVA proof of security.
The NOVA IVC scheme is knowledge sound if the non-interactive folding scheme is knowledge-sound and the hash function is collision
resistant.

IVC scheme is a 3-tuple with the following algorithms:
Setup(1^L, n) -> takes in security parameter 1^L and a polynomial circuit size bound n \in N and outputs a public parameter pp
P(pp, F, (i, z_0, z_1), \pi) -> public parameter, function that maps {0,1}^2 -> {0,1}, index, initial input, final input, IVC proof,
and outputs a new IVC proof \pi_1
V(pp, F, (i, z_0, z_1), \pi) -> outputs an accept or reject state

Essentially, P is the prover that comes up with every next folding scheme and V is the verifier to accept or reject that proof.

Commitment scheme using R, a finite commutative ring is a 2-tuple with the following algorithms
Setup(1^L, R, n) -> outputs public paramter pp from security parameter, R, and bound n \in N
Commit(pp, x) -> outputs a commitment C from pp and input x \in R^n

commitments are additively homomorphic and succint (less than size poly(L, log(n)))
