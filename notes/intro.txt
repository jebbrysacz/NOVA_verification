NOVA uses the pasta curves over large natural fields - both are of the form y^2 = x^3 + 5.
ECs of this form are in the class of curves known as the Weierstrass normal form.
They form a 2-cycle of curves as desired - number of points on one curve is equal to the size of the field of the next.
This means the pallas curve has the same number of points as the size of the vesta curve, and vice versa.

Since the fiat-crypto library has built-in implementation for Weierstrass form curves, we can use existing
implementations from that library to build our library of results of the Pasta 2-cycle of curves.
Additionally, since these curves are taken over large finite fields, we will need to use Coq's big num library to
represent them.
